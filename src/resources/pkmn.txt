So obviously competitive Pokemon depends a lot on your Pokémon stats, a Pokémon's IVs, EVs and natures, all factor in. And if you don't know what those are, you can check out my video on that link right up there.
When you breed a Pokémon with one of its regular abilities, the mother that is either the female or the non-Ditto Pokémon has an 80% chance of passing that particular ability down.
That is, if you were to go on Bulbapedia or Serebii and look at a Pokémon's information page, the first of the two abilities listed is the one it will go to.
The real thing you want to know about is the case of egg moves. So, the way egg moves worked when they were first conceived of is that when they were done in a male female mating pair, that is, no Dittos involved, the male Pokémon, which could be of any species, so long as it's in the same egg group as the female, could pass down certain moves to the baby that it could not learn otherwise.
