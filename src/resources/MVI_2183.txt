I am hoping to God this takes. I need you to that. I cannot do it.

So I guess we're just. We're trusting it then. I guess.

Hello there. So summer's winding down, and I thought, Let's take the day to talk about one of my favorite Pokemon games to come out in recent years. Yes, we are talking about Pokemon, Sun and Moon. So. So. 2016. So 2016 was a really strange time for the Pokemon series. Pokemon Go had launched that summer and now that's the Generation six games that are only released to Games X and Y, and then the remakes of Ruby Sapphire.

And many people were expecting that there's going to be some type of follow up a Pokemon Z, so to speak. Obviously, obviously, this game would feature the third mascot, legendary Z Guard. However, early 2016 brought something kind of interesting. Instead of getting a game about Z guard, we got this. Yes, you saw that, right? They announced the seventh generation of Pokemon without giving Zygote a game.

00:02:29:23 - 00:03:24:27

And so it was a case of what exactly are they going to be doing with that? Like, that is that's a better idea in many, in many senses, it felt to date certainly to go back a little bit, then. However. Okay. So February 27th, however, on February 27th, 2016, the unexpected happened on the 20th anniversary of Pokemon Red and Green's release in Japan.

00:03:24:29 - 00:03:57:12

Game Freak announced Pokemon Sun and Moon the first two games in the seventh generation of Pokemon, and arguably this caused a fair amount of confusion. Why exactly are they remaking these games? Rather, why exactly are these games coming out when Pokemon Z has not? And it sparked a ton of speculation of how Z Guard was going to end up being involved in this generation.

00:03:57:14 - 00:04:14:20

And a lot of the theories ended up being mostly false, but was still an interesting time.

Flash forward to October. Flash forward to October 18th of that same year. And we were flash forward to October 18th of that same year where we were introduced.

year. This demo was kind of interesting. It featured about an hour's worth of gameplay that sort of gave you the sort of give you a general idea of what the game would play like and what some of the new mechanics were. But more importantly, and why this demo is significant is that it had a fairly interesting reward for completing it.

By completing this demo, you received a grant. By completing this demo, you can transfer a level 36 Greninja into Pokemon, Sun Moon and not just any religion. This Greninja had the ability to battle bond which would allow it to transform into the ash greninja form seen in the anime to this date. Even though asteroid India is now no longer part of the game's.

00:05:57:27 - 00:06:12:18

This is the only way to get a greninja with battle bond.

The following month on November 18th. The following month, November 18th, 2016. And then five days later in Europe, the Games released and overall the games were met with pretty. And overall, the games were met with mostly positive reviews. The games have a general rule and overall the games were met with generally favorable reviews. This was a game that was, for all intents and purposes, seen as good.

16.3 million throughout the games. But throughout the game's distribution, the game dropped the game's distribution. They sold a combined 16.3 million copies, making it at the time, the fifth making it the fifth highest selling Pokemon game. Of all the games that had come out to that point and the seventh overall, and due to the fact that these are some of my favorite games on the 3DS family as well as and due to the fact that these are some of the more interesting games in the 3DS family as well as the fact that and due to the fact that these games are some of my favorite on the 3DS family and the fact that just overall

they and due to the fact that these are some of my favorite games in the 3DS family and the fact that they introduced a fair number of significant account mechanics, I thought today we could take a deep dive into what Pokemon Sun and Moon were and what exactly and what exactly they did right, what they did wrong. Because there are a few things.

00:08:21:05 - 00:08:54:00

And just overall what these Games legacy is for the overall Pokemon franchise. And with that and with that, I'm probably going to go inside because the sun is beating down really hard and even when I'm in the pool, it's a bit hot and, and and yeah it's not the. And also and I would like to just record the rest of the video in a more controlled lighting setting where I have air conditioning.
