I am hoping to God this takes. I need to stand right here. I cannot see what I'm doing. I need to stand right here.

So I guess we're just trusting it then, I guess.

Hello there! So summer's winding down and I thought, let's take today to talk about one of my favorite Pokemon games to come out in recent years. Yes, we are talking about Pokemon Sun and Moon. So 2016 was a really strange time for the Pokemon series. Pokemon go ahead and launch that summer and... now that's in the wrong order. The Generation 6 games had only released two games, X and Y, and then the remakes of Ruby and Sapphire.

00:01:55:06 - 00:02:29:20

And many people were expecting that there was gonna be some type of follow-up, a Pokemon Z so to speak. Obviously, obviously this game would feature the third mascot legendary, Zygarde. However, early 2016 brought something kind of interesting. Instead of getting a game about Zygarde, we got this. Yes, you saw that right. They announced the seventh generation of Pokemon without giving Zygarde a game.

00:02:29:23 - 00:03:24:27

And so it was a case of what exactly are they going to be doing with that? That can't... that... I need some... That's better. I'm sorry. In many... in many senses it felt too... I forgot the date. So I need to go back a little bit then. However... February 27th... However, on February 27th, 2016, the unexpected happened. On the 20th anniversary of Pokemon Red and Greens released in Japan...

Game Freak announced Pokemon Sun and Moon, the first two games in the seventh generation of Pokemon. And arguably this caused a fair amount of confusion. Why exactly are they remaking these games rather... Why exactly are these games coming out when Pokemon Z has not? And it sparked a ton of speculation of how Zygarde was going to end up being involved in this generation.

00:03:57:14 - 00:04:14:19

And a lot of those theories ended up being mostly false, but it was still an interesting time.

flash forward to October 18th of that same year. And we numbered, flash forward to October 18th of that same year. Where we were, flash forward to October 18th of that same year, we were, flash forward to October 18th of that same year, where we were introduced to the demo, flash forward to October 18th of the same year, where we had a flash forward to October 18th of the same year, where a demo hit the 3DS eShop. A demo that remained available up until the, a demo that remained available up until the shutting down of the eShop, or a demo that remained available up until the eShop was shut down early.

this year. This demo was kind of interesting. It featured about an hour's worth of gameplay that sort of gave you a general idea of what the game would play like and what some of the new mechanics were. But more importantly, and why this demo is significant, is that it had a fairly interesting reward for completing it.

By completing this demo, you can transfer a level 36 Greninja into Pokemon Sun and Moon. And not just any Greninja. This Greninja had the ability Battle Bond, which would allow it to transform into the Ash Greninja form seen in the anime. To this date, even though Ash Greninja is now no longer part of the games...

00:05:57:26 - 00:06:12:18

This is the only way to get a Greninja with Battle Bond.

16.3 million. Throughout the game's distribution, they sold a combined 16.3 million copies, making it at the time the fifth highest selling Pokemon game of all the games that had come out to that point, and the seventh overall. And due to the fact that these are some of my favorite games on the 3DS family, as well as... And due to the fact that these are some of the more interesting games in the 3DS family, as well as the fact that... And due to the fact that these games are some of my favorite on the 3DS family, and to the fact that just overall...

They inter- and due to the fact that these are some of my favorite games in the 3DS family, and the fact that they introduced a fair number of significant mechanics, I thought today we could take a deep dive into what Pokemon Sun and Moon were, and what exactly they did right, what they did wrong, because there are a few things.

00:08:21:05 - 00:08:54:00

And just overall what these games legacy is for the overall Pokemon franchise. And with that, I'm probably going to go inside because the sun is beating down really hard and even when I'm in the pool it's a bit hot. And... and... and yeah, it's not the... and also... And I would like to just record the rest of this video in a more controlled lighting setting where I have air-converbed.
