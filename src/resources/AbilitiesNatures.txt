00:00:00:00 - 00:00:06:58
Unknown
So obviously competitive Pokemon depends a lot on your Pokemon stats. A Pokemon's, IVs, IVs and natures all factor in.

00:00:06:58 - 00:00:10:33
Unknown
And if you don't know what those are, you can check out my video on that link right up there.

00:00:10:33 - 00:00:24:05
Unknown
But beyond those things, when you prepare a Pokemon to be brought into the competitive scene, you also want to pay attention to things like its ability and its moves. So that's what this video is going to focus on. I'm going to explain some of the ins and outs of Pokemon Abilities and Moves.

00:00:24:05 - 00:00:29:38
Unknown
And I'm also going to touch on some things that are not as important in some cases, but you still need to know,

00:00:29:38 - 00:00:32:02
Unknown
namely variations between Pokemon forms.

00:00:32:16 - 00:00:37:57
Unknown
And how to get Pokemon of various terror types. Because trust illustration is actually pretty important to the current matter.

00:00:37:57 - 00:00:41:09
Unknown
I'm going to start with abilities because this is actually a pretty straightforward topic.

00:00:41:09 - 00:00:45:43
Unknown
so what abilities were first introduced, a Pokemon would have one or two abilities depending on the species.

00:00:45:48 - 00:00:48:06
Unknown
Those that have one always have that particular ability

00:00:48:06 - 00:00:50:53
Unknown
And those that have to have that ability chosen at random when they're generated.

00:00:50:53 - 00:00:56:23
Unknown
However, starting in Generation five, a new type of ability was introduced. A Pokemon was hidden ability.

00:00:56:23 - 00:00:59:14
Unknown
Initially, this was linked to the now defunct Pokemon Dreamworld.

00:00:59:14 - 00:01:03:09
Unknown
Since then, however, Game Freak has changed the various ways that you can get these abilities.

00:01:03:09 - 00:01:06:24
Unknown
the primary way you get them now, no surprise is through raids

00:01:06:24 - 00:01:10:42
Unknown
Like with IVs. Pokemon with Hidden Abilities can be found in higher star raids.

00:01:10:42 - 00:01:14:08
Unknown
However, let's say you want to take a Pokemon and breed it.

00:01:14:08 - 00:01:15:53
Unknown
Can it still have its hidden ability?

00:01:15:53 - 00:01:18:06
Unknown
The answer to that question actually is yes.

00:01:18:06 - 00:01:28:01
Unknown
When you read a Pokemon with one of its regular abilities, the mother that is either the female or the non ditto Pokemon has an 80% chance of passing that particular ability down.

00:01:28:01 - 00:01:30:25
Unknown
In the case of hidden abilities, the odds are 60%.

00:01:30:25 - 00:01:40:44
Unknown
however, say you don't want to go through breeding, especially because the breeding mechanics in scarlet and violet are kind of annoying and I don't quite understand how they work.

00:01:40:49 - 00:01:45:02
Unknown
I miss the old way of just running back and forth until the day care man tells you you have an egg.

00:01:45:02 - 00:01:52:39
Unknown
either way though, the two ways you can change your pokemon's ability after it's been obtained are through the ability, capsule and ability patch items.

00:01:52:39 - 00:01:55:19
Unknown
The ability capsule works for Pokemon with one of its regular abilities.

00:01:55:19 - 00:01:58:54
Unknown
By using this item you can switch from one of those abilities to the other,

00:01:58:54 - 00:02:02:06
Unknown
This obviously only works with pokemon that have two possible abilities.

00:02:02:06 - 00:02:08:57
Unknown
In the case of the ability patch. When it was first introduced, this was meant for taking a pokemon with one of its regular abilities and switching to its hidden ability.

00:02:09:14 - 00:02:18:03
Unknown
as a scarlet and violet, it also works in the reverse order. You can take a Pokemon that has a hidden ability and revert back to one of its normal abilities.

00:02:18:03 - 00:02:22:04
Unknown
In the case of a Pokemon with two possible abilities, it'll pick the ability in the first slot.

00:02:22:04 - 00:02:26:29
Unknown
at it as if you were to go on board the PD or Sarah B and look at a Pokemon's information page.

00:02:26:34 - 00:02:33:25
Unknown
The first of the two abilities listed is the one it will go to, but obviously from there you can just use an ability capsule if that's not the one you want.

00:02:33:25 - 00:02:43:58
Unknown
interestingly enough, unlike with hyper training or mints, a pokemon that has its ability changed with the ability patch actually can pass the hidden ability down through breeding.

00:02:43:58 - 00:02:50:06
Unknown
Either way though, we got to move on to move. So Pokemon Learn moves in various ways by leveling up.

00:02:50:06 - 00:02:52:58
Unknown
some learn moves specifically when they evolve.

00:02:53:03 - 00:03:00:26
Unknown
Different games have moved shooters that could teach special moves and obviously you've got teams which are now single use again.

00:03:00:26 - 00:03:04:50
Unknown
however, they are now infinitely purchasable from the team machine.

00:03:04:50 - 00:03:06:50
Unknown
You need to bring a couple of things to make a team.

00:03:06:50 - 00:03:13:57
Unknown
you first need a certain amount of leak points depending on the particular moving question as well as a specific set of materials to craft the team with.

00:03:14:29 - 00:03:17:50
Unknown
These are obtained by catching or defeating Wild Pokemon throughout the player region.

00:03:17:50 - 00:03:22:17
Unknown
there is a third thing you need though. You need to have actually obtained the team at least once.

00:03:22:17 - 00:03:26:46
Unknown
However, once that condition is met, you can make as many as you want provided you have sufficient materials.

00:03:26:46 - 00:03:30:34
Unknown
However, my guess is that's not really the thing you guys are concerned with.

00:03:30:34 - 00:03:33:38
Unknown
The real thing you want to know about is the case of egg moves.

00:03:33:38 - 00:03:35:49
Unknown
so the way egg moves worked when they were first conceived of.

00:03:35:49 - 00:03:45:52
Unknown
Is that when they were done in a male female mating pair that is no denotes involved the male Pokemon which can be of any species so long as it's in the same egg group as the female

00:03:45:52 - 00:03:49:23
Unknown
could passed on certain moves to the baby that it could not learn otherwise.

00:03:49:23 - 00:04:01:33
Unknown
and that's all well and good. However, there are a specific subset of Pokemon that are either gender unknown or exclusively male, which meant they were essentially excluded from egg moves. However,

00:04:01:33 - 00:04:02:29
Unknown
that changed.

00:04:02:29 - 00:04:08:44
Unknown
The current generation nine mechanics is that by holding the mirror or item and having a picnic,

00:04:08:44 - 00:04:13:49
Unknown
Pokemon can pick up any of its egg moves from any of the members of your party you have out.

00:04:13:49 - 00:04:25:52
Unknown
This makes learning these moves extremely easy. All you need is this one item and a Pokemon with the correct move. It's honestly quite simple to the point where why would you ever consider breeding for moves again?

00:04:25:52 - 00:04:34:46
Unknown
the big caveat, though, is unlike Pokemon Hatched with Egg moves. Pokemon Learn moves this way will not be able to relearn them when they forget those moves.

00:04:34:46 - 00:04:43:42
Unknown
however, if you're not deleting one of those moves and then later decide, Hey, I actually want this move for my set, it's quite easy to actually get that particular move.

00:04:43:42 - 00:04:49:08
Unknown
One last thing you do need to know is that you usually need to remove a move from your move pool before you do this.

00:04:49:08 - 00:04:55:51
Unknown
beyond that, there are certain event Pokemon that come with moves that they just can't learn otherwise. Then you have to be careful though, is

00:04:55:51 - 00:05:01:51
Unknown
when a Pokemon goes through Pokemon home. The game actually saves different iterations of its moveset.

00:05:02:09 - 00:05:08:54
Unknown
So if you're a transfer Pokemon from say, Sword and Shield or Legends Arceus into Scarlet and Violet, it would have its moves completely reset.

00:05:08:54 - 00:05:11:59
Unknown
However it would regain those moves once it's transferred back to its original game.

00:05:11:59 - 00:05:16:45
Unknown
So those are the two major topics I wanted to talk about. The last couple things I want to talk about are

00:05:16:45 - 00:05:18:31
Unknown
Pokemon with specific forms

00:05:18:31 - 00:05:21:44
Unknown
obviously I'm not concerned about Pokemon that can change their forms.

00:05:21:44 - 00:05:26:41
Unknown
Pokemon like Ro, Tom or Kelly Rex have a fairly easy way to switch between their various forms.

00:05:26:41 - 00:05:29:56
Unknown
however, some Pokemon have permanent forms that can't be changed.

00:05:29:56 - 00:05:33:03
Unknown
like, say, like in rock or any of the various regional forms.

00:05:33:03 - 00:05:35:51
Unknown
So I'm going to start with all the forms that are non-regional

00:05:35:51 - 00:05:49:56
Unknown
so obviously a Pokemon caught with that form can't have their form changed at all. However, in the case of breeding, the way the forms are passed down is usually determined by the female Pokemon. So say you have to shell out. One is easy, one is West Sea.

00:05:49:56 - 00:05:54:01
Unknown
and if you breed those two, whichever one was female is what the baby will be.

00:05:54:01 - 00:06:03:33
Unknown
However, that is not the case, strangely enough, for regional forms, which makes absolutely no sense. But this one's fairly easy to work with as well.

00:06:03:33 - 00:06:09:54
Unknown
typically when a Pokemon hatches from an egg, it hatches with the form that is native to that particular region.

00:06:09:59 - 00:06:19:47
Unknown
That is to say, a whooper hatched and how there will always be de and super. However, there are ways to get a johto super if you so desire.

00:06:19:47 - 00:06:24:33
Unknown
The way you do that is by taking a super or quagmire and having it hold the ever stone.

00:06:24:33 - 00:06:28:17
Unknown
that will force the hatch to the original form of that particular Pokemon.

00:06:28:17 - 00:06:38:26
Unknown
The big caveat though, is Pokemon that don't have regional forms all the way through their evolution line are not actually able to get their specific regional forms out of eggs.

00:06:38:26 - 00:06:41:40
Unknown
so cases like alolan, right. You need to be transferred in.

00:06:41:40 - 00:06:41:56
Unknown
it's

00:06:41:56 - 00:06:45:25
Unknown
unfortunate but that is currently the way it stands.

00:06:45:25 - 00:06:46:51
Unknown
Moving on to our final topic.

00:06:46:51 - 00:06:52:32
Unknown
terror types are usually just generated as one of the two types of that particular Pokemon species.

00:06:52:32 - 00:07:03:41
Unknown
note that the game doesn't care about any potential evolution type changes. It cares only about the species in question. However, there are ways to get Pokemon with nontraditional terror types.

00:07:03:46 - 00:07:08:54
Unknown
Obviously, there are the wild terrestrial Pokemon that can be found out in the wild as well as through raids.

00:07:08:54 - 00:07:22:53
Unknown
however, say you want to take a Pokemon that isn't found in raids like, say, one of the starters and terrorist allies that into a different type. How do you do that? Well, this is by far the greatest of all the things you would need to do.

00:07:22:53 - 00:07:32:23
Unknown
what you want to do is you actually want to partake in raids of that particular type that you desire. That is, say you have a skeleton that you want to be Tara fairy.

00:07:32:23 - 00:07:36:27
Unknown
You would then go out into the region and take on as many fairy raids as possible.

00:07:36:32 - 00:07:39:07
Unknown
Higher star raids usually yield more shards.

00:07:39:07 - 00:07:46:44
Unknown
And eventually by doing this over and over again, you should be able to get enough shards to change your Pokemon stereotype. But how many is that number?

00:07:46:44 - 00:07:52:59
Unknown
50. The number is 50. So, yeah, it's not fun

00:07:52:59 - 00:07:55:30
Unknown
Either way, though, once you manage to get those shards,

00:07:55:30 - 00:08:02:16
Unknown
What you want to do is you want to go to this guy here in Madeley and give him 50 shares of the type that you desire.

00:08:02:16 - 00:08:05:56
Unknown
and from there the Pokemon stereotype is changed.

00:08:05:56 - 00:08:13:57
Unknown
and unlike much the other things, terror types can't be bred. So this is the only way to change them or control them outside of raids.

00:08:13:57 - 00:08:20:42
Unknown
and obviously this is going to not matter in a couple of years when we're into Generation ten and we have a new regional gimmick.

00:08:20:47 - 00:08:26:03
Unknown
But for now, to play in the scarlet and violent metagame, that's what you have to put up with.

00:08:26:03 - 00:08:45:22
Unknown
And with that, that covers everything I wanted to talk about in this video. I hope you enjoyed this video because next time we're going to finally actually get to talk about team building. I have gone through all of the individual topics that you need to know in order to actually get Pokemon with the desired sets. So now we need to talk about what those sets actually are.

00:08:45:27 - 00:08:48:11
Unknown
And so I will see you next time.

00:08:48:11 - 00:09:03:15
